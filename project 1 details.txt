What's the game?

The game is going to be called "Catch up!"

The idea behind it is that the game would simulate a moving board/block of buttons containing numbers/letters in random order. The aim of the game is to click on those buttons in the logical order.

The twist is that the player would have to not mistakenly click the wrong button as the whole block is moving.
